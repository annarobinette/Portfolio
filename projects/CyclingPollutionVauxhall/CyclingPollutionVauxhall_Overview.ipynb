    "# Introduction\n",
    "Air pollution from vehicle emissions seriously affects the health of citizens in London, and over recent years schemes have been implemented to reduce air pollution and to increase bike share infrastructure to support active travel. As a cycling commuter, I wanted insight into how the change from the T-charge zone (affecting diesel vehicles) to the original ULEZ area (affecting all vehicles) in 2019 affected the levels of pollution and the hire of bicycles. The study location is near my office in Vauxhall has an air monitoring station close to the original ULEZ border and four nearby TfL cycle docking stations.\n",
    " \n",
    "Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) data was sourced from LondonAir for a year on either side of ULEZ implementation with 52,562 rows and 4 columns. TfL bike share open data was filtered for time range and start/stop locations in Vauxhall (413,289 rows, 8 columns). The data was processed and analysed on Kaggle using Python and its Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries.\n",

    "The T-charge (Toxicity Charge) was introduced on October 23, 2017 and the original ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) was launched on April 8, 2019 to improve air quality in London. The T-charge covered the same area as the Congestion Charge zone in central London and the original ULEZ initially covered the same area as the Congestion Charge zone, but was designed to be expanded in later phases\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-charge operated on Monday to Friday from 7 am to 6 pm while the original ULEZ runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. On October 25, 2021, the ULEZ was significantly expanded to cover all areas within the North and South Circular Roads.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "There is an average decrease (28%) in NO2 from January to July, particularly after the policy change to include all vehicles. In winter months, there is an increase in NO2, perhaps because more people use cars to travel due to adverse weather. Supporting this, January and February of each year had the lowest rates of bike hire. In 2020 NO2 levels started increasing overall in May rather than September, and there was no notable change in bike hire, suggesting people were using personal transport to avoid COVID-19 rather than hire a TfL bike.\n",
    "From this study, one correlation I can draw is that as NO2 levels increased, the length of bike hires decreased. Further studies would include more locations, a wider time range, data from private bike share companies and on the use of private bikes."

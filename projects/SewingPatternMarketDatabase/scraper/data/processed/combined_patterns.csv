Note: Use the Cross Stitching for Garments pattern to add cross stitch embellishment to your Remy.","Light weight woven fabrics that are not too stiff such as linen, linen/rayon or linen/viscose blends, cotton voile, silk noil, sand-washed silk and cotton gauze. Be aware that one sided prints do not work for the rolled-up sleeves. Be sure that the front and back sides of your fabric are presentable.
This top was originally designed for very light weight linen. While it can work in a variety of light weight woven fabrics, this top is the perfect, simple backdrop to let a beautiful linen shine. If you choose a more rigid fabric such as cotton lawn, the neck may appear a little smaller and the bottom hem will be a bit fuller and not drape as closely to the body.","Allow extra fabric if matching stripes, plaids or using border prints.

NOTE: This is not a complete pattern. The instructions are in the book The Savile Row Suit by Patrick Grant (sold separately here). You must own a copy of the book to make this pattern. 
IMPORTANT: This pattern is in one men’s size only. Our understanding is that Patrick Grant designed the patterns in the book in a single size to give readers the opportunity to try out making each garment following the instructions, testing out traditional tailoring techniques which can then be applied to real-life projects. The book focuses on the history, process and skills of tailoring.
If you have any queries about the book or pattern, please contact the publisher directly at hello@gestalten.com.
About the book: Savile Row is the home of bespoke tailoring. In this book, Patrick Grant, co-owner of Savile Row tailors Norton & Sons, describes the long-standing traditions of craftsmanship maintained in the workrooms of this quiet corner of London’s Mayfair. He celebrates the extraordinary ecosystem, from the British weavers and cloth houses to the trimmings merchants, that allows Savile Row to flourish. Grant shines a light on the captivating story of Savile Row and the painstaking processes required to create a bespoke garment. This book details, for the first time, the complete methods of several of Savile Row’s finest sewing tailors, providing a detailed step-by-step manual on how to hand-make a pair of trousers, waistcoat and coat in the Savile Row style, and a shirt in the style of one of Jermyn Street’s finest shirt makers. Richly illustrated, it gives an insight into a highly discreet and rarefied world of craftsmanship.

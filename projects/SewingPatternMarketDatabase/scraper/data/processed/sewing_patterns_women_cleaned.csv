Many customers inquired about the top and so it became the Remy Raglan pattern.
This top was designed to have the sleeves rolled up and it should be noted the sleeves look best that way. The fit is very loose and relaxed at the bust and waist, and while it is not a cropped top, it is a short top designed to be worn with high waist pants and skirts.
The original design is version #1, plain and simple. Version #2 offers a little visual interest at the front with a split centre and keyhole button closure. There are two sleeve options - short sleeves and 3/4-length sleeves - and both work with either version #1 or version #2.
